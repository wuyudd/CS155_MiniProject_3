// Created and Modified by Yu Wu.

This is MiniProject_3 for CS 155, Caltech.

Group Member: Haotian Sheng, Sha Sha, Yu Wu.

We use Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in this project. We finally generate sonnets which satisfy the requirement of exact 10 syllables and rhyme rule.

The details can be found in our report (we will put it onto the github after the ddl.)
